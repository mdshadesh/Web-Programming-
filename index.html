				<p><em>The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2013 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly 
					generated 1,281,500 jobs in 2012 or 1.8 percent of the country's total employment, which ranked Bangladesh 157 out of 178 c
					ountries worldwide.</em></p>
				<p>S Direct and indirect employment in the industry totalled <a href="#">2,714,500 jobs,</a> or 3.7 percent of the country's total employment.[4] 
					The WTTC predicted that by 2023, travel and tourism will directly generate 1,785,000 jobs and support an overall total of 3,891,000 
					jobs, or 4.2 percent of the country's total employment.[4] This would represent an annual growth rate in direct jobs of 2.9 percent.[4] 
					Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[4] Bangladesh's world ranking in 
					2012 for travel and tourism's direct contribution to GDP, as a percentage of GDP, was 142 out of 176</p>
				<p>in 2014 125,000 tourists visited Bangladesh. This number is extremely low relative to total population. As of 22 May 2019 the total local 
					population numbering <a helf = "#55acee"> 166,594,000 inhabitants.</a> This gives a ratio of 1 tourist for every 1,333 locals.</p>

					<h1>Cox's Bazar</h1>
				     <img src="E:\web programming\turiesm in bangladesh\images\unnamed (2).jpg" alt="image" class="img_float_r img_frame" />
					<p><em>
						Cox's Bazar (Bengali: কক্সবাজার Kaksbajar) is a seaside town, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. </em></p>
					<p>It is known for its wide and long sandy beach, which is considered by many as the world's longest natural sandy sea beach.
						[3][5] The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 125 kilometres (78 mi) sandy sea beach with a gentle slope. 
						It is located 152 kilometres (94 mi) south of the Chittagong Seaport. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, 
						whose literal translation means "yellow flower". Its other old name was "Palongkee"
					</p>
					<p>From the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of Arakan 
						kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666 AD.[4] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through 
						the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. 
						He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named 
						Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the 
						control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.

						The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer, Captain Hiram Cox, 
						who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar) outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, 
						who became the Governor of Bengal following the British East India Company Act in 1773. Cox embarked upon the task o
						f rehabilitation and settlement of the Arakanese refugees in the area.[5] He rehabilitated many refugees in the area, b
						ut died in 1799 before finishing his work. To commemorate him, a market was established and named after him, called 
						Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first established in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.[4]
						
						After the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British East India Company was highly criticised on humanitarian grounds, 
						specially for its opium trade monopoly over the Indian Sub-Continent. However, after its dissolution on 1 January 1874, 
						the company's assets, including its armed forces, were acquired by the British Crown. After this takeover, 
						Cox's Bazar was declared a district of the Bengal Province under the British Crown.</p>

						St. Martin's Island (Bengali: সেন্ট মার্টিন্স দ্বীপ) is a small island (area only 8 km2) in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, 
						about 9 km south of the tip of the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. </em></p>
					<p>There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chhera island. It is about 8 km west of the northwest coast 
						of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River. The first settlement started just 250 years ago by some Arabian sailors who named the island 
						'Zajira'. During British occupation the island was named St. Martin Island. The local names of the island are "Narical Gingira", also spelled 
						"Narikel Jinjira/Jinjera", which means 'Coconut Island' in Bengali, and "Daruchini Dip". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh."
					</p>
					<p>The city of Chittagong has many high end, private hotels such as the Hotel Agrabad, the Hotel Well Park Residence, The Peninsula Chittagong, 
						 Hotel Harbour View, the Hotel Meridian, and Avenue Hotels and Suites.
						The JW Marriott, Westin and Radisson Blu are among the upcoming five-star hotels in Chittagong city.[6][7][8]</p>

				<h1>Wildlife in Bangladesh</h1>
				<img src="E:\web programming\turiesm in bangladesh\images\2021-03-31 (2).jpg" alt="Image 01" class="img_float_l img_frame" />
				<p><em>Bangladesh is home to several well-known mammals including the Bengal tiger, 
					the Asian elephant, the hoolock gibbon and the Asian black bear.</em></p>
				<p> The saltwater crocodile found in Sunderban is the largest of all living reptiles, The king cobra is the world's longest venomous s
					nake and the reticulated python is the longest among all snakes. The country has roughly 53 species of amphibian, 19 species of 
					marine reptiles, 139 species of reptiles, 380 species of birds, 116 species of mammals, and 5 species of marine mammals. In addition 
					to the large bird count, a further 310 species of migratory birds swell bird numbers each year. The vast majority of these creatures 
					currently dwell in an area of land that is approximately 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi) in size. The dhole, also called the A
					siatic wild dog, is now endangered by habitat, prey-species loss, and human persecution. Notable animal species that have disappeared from 
					Bangladesh are the one- and two-horned rhinoceros, the gaur, the banteng, swamp deer, nilgai, Indian wolf, wild water buffalo, marsh 
					crocodile and common peafowl. </p>
				<p>The world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans is located in Southwestern Bangladesh. 
					Sundarbans National Parks are UNESCO World Heritage Site..</p>

					<h3>Tourism campaign films</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>In January 2011, two short films titled Beautiful Bangladesh: School of Life were produced by Bangladesh Tourism Board 
							(partner of ICC World Cup Cricket 2011). Both films show a tourist's journey through Bangladesh. The durations of the 
							films were 10 and 3 minutes. The 10-minute-long film was directed by Moinul Hossain Mukul and the 3-minute-long film was 
							directed by Gazi Ahmed Shubhro. Concept and script by Syed Gousul Alam Shaon.</p>

					<h3>Shopping</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>While muslin of ancient Dhaka has gone into history, other products such as contemporary paintings, wood works,
							 shital pati (mats that feel cool), bamboo decoration pieces, cane and conch shell products, gold and silver 
							 ornament, cotton, silk, gold, silver, jute, reed, brass ware, traditional dolls and leather goods also receive 
							 deep appreciation of the lovers of arts and crafts now and over the past centuries. In addition, Bangladesh is f
							 amous for pink pearl.[48] </p>
